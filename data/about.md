CMS project
============

### Introduction

The *goal* of this project is to build a simple file-based content management system. 
This project uses a new format that presents each assignment in three parts: a list of **requirements**, a list of **implementation details**, and an **example solution** that takes the requirements and implementation details into account.

> Some of the assignments will contain ***Hints***. They are there to help keep you on track, so don't hesitate to look at them after coming up with a plan on your own.
